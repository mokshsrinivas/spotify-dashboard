# The Spotify Dashboard

Hi, this is my Final Project for CS396 which utilizes a Spotify API.

Here is the website: https://spotify-dashboard-jet.vercel.app

This shouldn't need to run locally because you can just run the site on the link above but if you need to run it locally, in login.js, change redirect uri to http://localhost:3000/callback. run the command npm install react react-dom react-scripts helmet

## Available Featers

In this website you will find

### `Your Top 20 Songs`

Based on your listening history, you can find you top 20 most listened to songs.

### `Your Top 20 Artists`

Based on your listening history, you can find you top 20 most listened to artists.

### `Your Top 20 Albums`

Based on a combination of your top songs ranking and number of top songs in the album, you can see your top albums.

### `Search`

You can search for songs and play previews of each of them. The songs are presented in a better way than the current spotify search tool.
